I am a Researcher at Microsoft with the AI Red Team, where I focus on probing and improving the safety and security of frontier AI systems. I received my PhD in Computer Science from New York University, advised by [Dr. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}, with research centered on responsible AI and privacy technologies. 

Previously, I served as Research Manager at [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org){:target="_blank"}, mentoring 11 researchers in shaping impactful projects on AI alignment, control, evaluations and governance. Prior to that, I held research roles at the [Center for Cyber Security](https://cyber.nyu.edu){:target="_blank"} and [Spotify Tech Research](https://research.atspotify.com){:target="_blank"}, where I contributed to cross-disciplinary efforts at the intersection of technical innovation, security, and ethical oversight.

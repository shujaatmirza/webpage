#### About
<hr>

I am a Research Manager at [MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org){:target="_blank"}, where I guide scholars in shaping their research agendas and achieving program outcomes focused on AI alignment, interpretability, governance and strategy.

I earned my MPhil and PhD in AI at New York University under the mentorship of [Dr. Christina Pöpper](http://poepper.net){:target="_blank"}, supported by the Global PhD Fellowship. My research has been recognized with notable honors, including the Health Equity & Global Health Best Paper Award at ML4H 2023 and runner-up for the Andreas Pfitzmann Best Paper Award at PETS 2024.

Previously, I held roles at the [Center for Cyber Security](https://cyber.nyu.edu){:target="_blank"} and [Spotify Tech Research](https://research.atspotify.com){:target="_blank"}, where I contributed to projects at the intersection of technical innovation, security, and ethical oversight. Earlier, I attended college at NYU Abu Dhabi with peers from over 100 countries. During high school, I represented Pakistan’s national team in the [International Chemistry Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemistry_Olympiad){:target="_blank"}.
